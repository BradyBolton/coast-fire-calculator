# coast-fire-calculator

Quick CRA that attempts to calculate a coast FIRE number and date based on:

* FIRE number
* current age
* retirement age
* APR
* monthly contributions

This is especially useful for young high-income earners. An ideal scenario would be:

* Maximize savings while young for only 5-10 years
    * Max out tax-advantaged savings and accumulate funds in taxable brokerage
* Halt contributions and let time take care of the rest
* Maximize life experiences by dumping every dollar into travel
* Retire "early" at age 50 after ~20-25 years of recklessness

## To run

Run this by:

```
npm i
npm run start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Run basic tests for the coast fire calculations:

```
npm run test
```
