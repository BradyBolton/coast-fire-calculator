# coast-fire-calculator

Quick CRA that attempts to calculate a coast FIRE number and date based on:

* FIRE number
* current age
* retirement age
* APR
* monthly contributions

This is especially useful for young high-income earners. An ideal scenario would be:

* All gas / no brakes approach toward savings in 20s
    * Max out all tax-advantaged savings (no exceptions) and top off a little extra in a taxable brokerage
* Early 30s one can completely halt contributions
* Let time and compound interest take care of the rest
* Life-max to the fullest by dumping every conceivable dollar into housing, travel, projects etc.
* Retire "early" at age 50 after ~20-25 years of financial recklessness

After playing with the calculator, it is increasingly clear that shooting for a closer retirement date has diminishing returns. Unless you're earning a super high income, it might be more feasible to sprint toward a coast FIRE number instead. By the time you achieve coast FIRE, you're ready to switch gears and start contributing toward life's major milestones (kids, home, vacations) living like a typical American [HENRY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high-earners-not-yet-rich-henrys.asp#:~:text=High%20Earners%2C%20Not%20Rich%20Yet%20(HENRYs)%20is%20a%20term,enough%20to%20be%20considered%20rich.) (but also retire comfortably unlike a HENRY).
